# MiyoCalc40
 RPN calculator

This is a project for a trough-hole only RPN calculator with a flexible configuration. The idea is for it to be minimalist, meant as a complement to other tools that the 
user would typically have on hand (computer, formula cheat sheet, etc.) rather than as a replacement, and made with easy to solder through-hole components.
